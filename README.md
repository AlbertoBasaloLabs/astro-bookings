# AstroBookings 

A fictional space travel booking system used during training sessions and demos.

A **backend API** for offering bookings to launches in rockets.

- Launches are scheduled for specific rockets with pricing and minimum passenger thresholds.
- Rockets have limited seats; launch requests validate against rocket capacity.
- Launch status lifecycle: scheduled → confirmed → successful, or cancellation/suspension paths.
- A customer will be identified by their email address, having a name, and phone number.
- One customer can book multiple seats on a launch, but cannot exceed the available seats.
- Customers will be billed upon booking, and payments will be processed through a mock gateway.

> The system is designed for demonstration and training purposes. 
> > Not for production use; no security nor db needed at initial stage.
